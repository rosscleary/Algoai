# algoai
A React/Flask/TensorFlow app that tests inductive program synthesis for inputted programs. The user writes a program, specifies input conditions, and then the app trains an ML model on input/outputs from the program. Then it tests and displays the accuracy of different models of the program, using models such as linear regression, random forest, and neural networks.
